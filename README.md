# grblHAL_Backup
My grblHAL Config Backup for the MKS DLC32 v2.x

Im using a4988 Stepper Drivers with 1.8 degree Stepper motors from LDO and a grbl_spd spindle controller running a Makita Router.

To flash the firmware, use the MKS Laser Tool and a USB cable to flash my "mks_dlc32_gh_fw.bin" file. 

The "MKS Laser Tool" is the best flashing software I've found, and I've copied it to my GitHub repo as it's a PITA to locate.
You can also find it here: https://github.com/makerbase-mks/MKS-DLC32/tree/main/MKS-DLC32-main/firmware/tool

This firmware versrions is WiFi enabled.

The rest of the config is the same as any other board:
